# ⚠️ IMPORTANT - CACHE CLEARING REQUIRED

## Current Version: v4.3

If you see version v4.0, v4.1, v4.2 or ANY old UI elements, your browser is showing CACHED content.

## How to Clear Cache on Mobile:

### iPhone (Safari):
1. Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
2. OR: Hold down the refresh button → "Reload Without Content Blockers"

### Android (Chrome):
1. Chrome Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Clear data

### Alternative (Works on ALL devices):
Open in **Private/Incognito mode** - this bypasses ALL cache

## How to Verify it Worked:
Look at the top of the page - it should say "**Gitesh Life Tracker v4.3**"
